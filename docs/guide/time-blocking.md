# Time Blocking

**BuJo** supports time blocking syntax highlighting, based on the methodology
discussed in [Newport
(2016)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work). An example of a
time blocking table can be seen below:

<div class="showcase-image">
    <img src="/images/features/bujo-syntax-highlighting-time-blocking.png" alt="Highlighting for the time blocking table" width=500 class="mihai">
</div>

::: tip
Check out the [Snippets Reference](/reference/scopes.md) for handy snippets that
can be used to generate time blocking tables, add revisions, add chunks and
notes, and more.
