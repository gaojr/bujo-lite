**BuJo** is an extension that adds syntax highlighting for Bullet Journal
entries (e.g., tasks and events) and provides convenient commands, snippets, and
keybindings for managing tasks and notes in Markdown. It works best in
combination with [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) or
[Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) for an awesome way to turn VS Code
into a full-fledged personal knowledge management and productivity system.

## Syntax Highlighting

At the syntax highlighting level, **BuJo** parses the text written in Markdown
files for specific patterns and allows arbitrary colors to be mapped to
different parts of a **BuJo** entry. Out of the box, **BuJo** provides
highlighting for the standard Bullet Journal entries proposed by [Carroll
(2018)](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book). It also provides a way to select
and colorize markdown table grids, and tasks and time records within tables.

## Task Management

**BuJo** goes beyond syntax highlighting and taps into time tracking and time
blocking methodologies (e.g., [Newport,
2016](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)). To this end,
**BuJo** proposes commands and keybindings to effortlessly update task statuses,
plan working days, and track the time spent on tasks.
